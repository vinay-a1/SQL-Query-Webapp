# SQL QUERY WEB APP

This is a web-based application designed and implemnted in ReactJS which is capable of running SQL queries and displaying the results of said query.
I have designed my own queries whose query syntax rules are given below:-

## GET QUERY

* get all

    -to display all the entries

* get number
  
    -For example: type "get 5" to get 5 entries

## DELETE Query
* del all

    -to delete all the entries

* del number

    -For eexample: type "del 5" to delete 5 entries

## ADD Query
to insert any new data, the format should be as given below:

* add id:_ name:_ phone:_ age:_

    -"_"should be replaced by its value

    -For example: add id:4 name:Vinay phone:99999 age:21

** Run query: write your query in the input box and then click on "Run Query" to get result. **


## Used Framework
